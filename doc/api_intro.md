# API Documentation

Welcome to documentation for the salve project's JavaScript API.

The documentation is generated by ``typedoc`` from comments in the code. The
``typedoc`` tool is still very much alpha software (IMO). So this generated
documentation has some lacunae. For instance, the module that provides the
facade of the built library is [["validate"]], but if you look at it here,
you'll find it contains almost nothing. That's because ``typedoc`` does not
document reexported symbols (``export ... from ...`` statements). Until there is
a solution for this, you may need to also look at the actual source code to get
a complete picture.

# Salve's Internals

## The Modules

When you use the built version of salve, what you get is a single bundle which
exposes the symbols provided by the [["validate"]] module. This, and *only
this*, is available to you.

You can use the TypeScript files directly, in which case you could import any of
the modules documented here. Note however that the way salve is divided into
modules is not part of the public API. So if you do load modules directly, you
may have to update your code if modules are refactored.

If you were to incorporate salve into a larger TypeScript build and thus wanted
to use the TypeScript files directly rather than depend on the built bundle, you
could make your code load the [["validate"]] module. You'd then be using the the
public API.

## Context Cheats

Salve cheats when it comes to handling context for &lt;value>. Only
two types known to salve require a context: QName and NOTATION from
the XML Schema library. The ``salve-convert`` command does not
incorporate a context for them but instead uses the context in the
schema to transform the &lt;value> element so that @ns is set to the
URI under which the local-name in the &lt;value> element should be
interpreted, and the contents of &lt;value> is turned in to a local
name.

## Attributes vs Elements

There's a bit of a disconnect between how Relax NG specifies
attributes and elements and how these are represented in XML. In Relax
NG, it is perfectly doable and normal to mix attributes and elements
in patterns. In XML, however, attributes appear within an opening tag
and elements appear between opening and closing tags, outside of any
tags. This complicates validation somewhat. ``Pattern`` objects have
two methods that take an ``attribute`` argument telling them whether
they've been called in a context where only attributes are valid, or
not. These are ``canEnd`` and ``end``.

## Events

If you ever look at salve's internals be aware that as an
implementation convenience, patterns that accept ``text`` events also
accept ``attributeValue`` events. That is, ``fireEvent`` will accept
both. However, these elements will only return ``text`` as a possible
event. ``AttributeWalker`` is responsible to convert it to
``attributeValue``.
