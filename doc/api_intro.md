#API Documentation

Welcome to documentation for the salve project's JavaScript API.

##Note

By default, this documentation generated for salve includes only the
public API. You should consider any function at the top level of a
module that is marked `<inner>` to be public. These functions appear
as `<inner>` due to a limitation of jsdoc3.
